# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing! This guide helps you get started and explains how to contribute effectively.

## Ways to contribute
- Fix bugs, implement features
- Improve documentation or translations
- Add test coverage
- Help with ML dataset collection/annotation
- Improve CI/CD and infra templates

## First-time contributors
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/<short-desc>`
4. Run tests & linters locally
5. Commit with clear messages, push, and open a PR referencing an issue

## Branching & Commit Rules
- Branch: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`
- Commit message style:
  - `feat(scope): short description`
  - `fix(scope): short description`
  - `docs: update ...`

## Pull Request Process
- Link to the issue the PR addresses
- Provide a clear description and screenshots if UI-related
- Add tests where applicable
- Wait for at least one approval and CI green before merging

## Issue Etiquette

- Use templates (bug/feature/docs)
- Keep the discussion focused and polite

## Developer setup (local)
See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for specific local dev instructions.
